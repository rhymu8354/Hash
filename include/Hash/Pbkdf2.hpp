     * @param[in] prf
     *     This is a pseudorandom function of two parameters with output
     *     length hLen (e.g., a keyed HMAC)
     *
     * @param[in] hLen
     *     This is the output length, in bits, of the PRF.
     *
     * @param[in] password
     *     This is the master password from which a derived key is generated.
     *
     * @param[in] salt
     *     This is a sequence of bits, known as a cryptographic salt
     *     (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salt_(cryptography)).
     *
     * @param[in] c
     *     This is the number of iterations desired.
     *
     * @param[in] dkLen
     *     This is the desired byte-length of the derived key.
     *
     * @return
     *     The generated derived key is returned.
